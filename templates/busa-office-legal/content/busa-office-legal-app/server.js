/**
 * The ONLY sanctioned way for browser code to learn where it is running.
 *
 * Busabase spawns this very process when it hosts the app, and injects
 * `BUSABASE_AIRAPP_RUNTIME` (`browser` | `local` | `remote` | `embed`).
 * Nobody else sets it, so its absence is the positive fact "standalone".
 * This route re-exposes that to the browser, which cannot read env vars.
 *
 * Never classify the environment by hostname. A Busabase-hosted AirApp is
 * routinely served from `localhost` (Desktop/OSS runs on
 * `http://localhost:15419`), and a standalone `npm run dev` is routinely
 * reached over a LAN IP or a signed dev tunnel such as
 * `https://3111-….dev.budaapps.com`. Either hostname test misfires, and the
 * "not localhost ⇒ hosted" direction fails the worst: the app hides its own
 * connection gate, calls `/api/v1` with no credential, and shows the user an
 * error they have no way to act on.
 *
 * `devProxy` is a separate axis on purpose. "Where am I running" and "do I
 * have credentials" are two different states, and collapsing them into one
 * boolean is what produces UI claiming to be connected when it isn't. It
 * reports only the non-interactive env bootstrap; the interactive answer is
 * the gateway's own `/auth/status`.
 *
 * Browser code must fetch this RELATIVELY (`__airapp/runtime`, no leading
 * slash). Under the Local Node engine the app is reverse-proxied onto a
 * sub-path of busabase's origin, so a leading slash resolves against the
 * origin root — busabase itself — and 404s.
